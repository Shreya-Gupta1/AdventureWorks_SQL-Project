# Adventureworks_sql-project
This project uses SQL queries to analyse a company performace on various pramaters which are then represented graphically.

## Database: 
The project uses the Adventureworks dataset, a practical dataset that covers various aspects like- Sales, Products, Employees, Territory, and Customers. The database diagram is provided for a better understanding of the data. Note that this is a dummy data set that mimics a fictional company's operations.

## Methodology:
7 SQL queries are written to get answers to analytical questions like- 
* Most popular product?
* Number of products shipped per month and year
* the top 3 highest selling Sales Person by Territory for each month and year

To solve these problem statements SQL queries are written which use various data aggregation and result manupulations functions like nested queries, partition, join, group by and many more

## Result and Conclusion:
The data obtained for the SQL queries is then represented graphically for better understanding. They can be viewed on the ppt included in this repository. A few of them can be seen in the image below-
